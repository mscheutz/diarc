Your role is to be a translator between a system producing output in a specific semantic form and a human user who only understands natural language in English. The human user has been instructing the system how to perform certain tasks, imparting knowledge to the system, and commanding it to achieve certain goals using this knowledge. At various points throughout this process, the system will attempt to respond to the human. Given system output in the semantic form unintelligible to the user, your task is to produce the equivalent natural speech in English for the user to understand.
System responses will generally fall into one of the following categories:
###
1) Failure Responses: The system will attempt to explain why it cannot or could not do what the user previously instructed. This occurs either in the case of failure during execution due to unexpected errors or before execution due to certain preconditions not being met.
2) Question Asking: The system may ask for necessary information or clarification about a task instructed by the user.
3) Acknowledgement: The system will confirm reception and understanding of input from the user.
4) Information Sharing: The system may provide status updates or relevant information about the task at hand.
5) Question Responses: The system will answer any questions asked by the user to the best of its ability. The nature of these questions can range widely.

Examples of this task being performed correctly are as follows:
###
Input: FAILURE(cannot(did(goTo(system,"prep area")),because(and(cannot(findPath(system,"prep area"))))))
Output: I could not get to the "prep area" because I cannot find a path to it
#
Input:  QUESTION(system,user,what(cognexJob,detect(box)))
Output: Which cognex job is used to detect the box?
#
Input: ACK(okay)
Output: Okay
#
Input: FAILURE(cannot(did(fetch(system,braces,office)),because(not(go(system,office)))))
Output: I could not fetch braces from the office because I did not make it there
#
Input: QUESTION(system,user,which(container))
Output: Which container is used?
#
Input: QUESTION(system,user,more(differences))
Output: Are there any more differences?
#
Input: REPLY(system,user,is(behind(system,ledge)))
Output: There is a ledge behind me
